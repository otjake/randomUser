**What does this REPO do?**
<br>
This is static site to query results from an API with user details. 

**Technology used**
<br>
I utilized HTML,CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND JQUERY(which is a javascript library,used for HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation,
as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License


**How  should it be tested**
1. Clone repo into your local system
2. <a href="https://decagon01.herokuapp.com/">Link to site</a>

**Note**
<br>
1.Search should be done with first names (best name to use for almost sure results, Louane or Julia or Milan these names exist in this seed).<br>
2.For individual user details UUID was used as search criteria but API Dosen't have any uniqiue forms of identification.<br>
3.Country search was not implemented

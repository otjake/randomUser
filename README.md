**What does this REPO do?**
This is static site to query results from an API with user details. 

**Technology used**
I utilized HTML,CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND JQUERY(which is a javascript library,used for HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation,
as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License

**How  should it be tested**
1. Clone repo into your local severs,www directory(wampp) or htdocs(xampp),

**Note**
1.Search should be done with first names (best name to use for almost sure results, Louane or Julia or Milan these names exist in this seed).
2.For individual user details UUID was used as search criteria but API Dosen't have any uniqiue forms of identification.
3.Country search was not implemented
